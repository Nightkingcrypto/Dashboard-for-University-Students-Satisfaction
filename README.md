# University Students Survey — Smart Dashboard

This is a Streamlit dashboard that visualizes a university student survey Excel file.

Quick setup (Windows / PowerShell):

1. Create or activate a virtual environment (recommended):

   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

2. Install dependencies:

   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the app:

   python -m streamlit run app.py

Notes:
- The app expects an `.xlsx` file; if you have one named `university students survey data.xlsx` next to `app.py` it will be used by default, otherwise upload a file via the sidebar.
- If you get "No module named streamlit", run the install step above.
